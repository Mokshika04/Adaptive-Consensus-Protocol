# Adaptive Consensus Protocol for Blockchain Security  

## 🔥 Overview  
This project focuses on enhancing blockchain security using an **Adaptive Consensus Protocol** integrated with **AI-driven anomaly detection** to mitigate **51% attacks** and other vulnerabilities. The protocol dynamically adjusts consensus parameters based on network conditions, ensuring robustness against malicious actors.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **AI-driven Anomaly Detection** (Isolation Forest, ML models)  
- **Dynamic Consensus Mechanism**  
- **Blockchain Simulation using Ethereum Testnets & Ganache**  
- **Implementation with Solidity & Python**  
- **Security Enhancements Against 51% Attacks**  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity, Ganache  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn   
- **Development**: Python, Web3.py   
- **Data Analytics**: Pandas
